    <h1>1. Everyone Has a Story in Life</h1>
    <h2>A 24 year old boy seeing out from the train’s window shouted…

        “Dad, look the trees are going behind!”

        Dad smiled and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24 year old’s childish behavior with pity, suddenly
        he again exclaimed…

        “Dad, look the clouds are running with us!”

        The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old man…

        “Why don’t you take your son to a good doctor?” The old man smiled and said…“I did and we are just coming from
        the hospital, my son was blind from birth, he just got his eyes today.”

        Every single person on the planet has a story. Don’t judge people before you truly know them. The truth might
        surprise you.</h2>

        <h1>2. Shake off Your Problems</h1>

        <h2>A man’s favorite donkey falls into a deep precipice. He can’t pull it out no matter how hard he tries. He therefore
        decides to bury it alive.

        Soil is poured onto the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it off, and steps on it. More soil is
        poured.

        It shakes it off and steps up. The more the load was poured, the higher it rose. By noon, the donkey was grazing in
        green pastures.

        After much shaking off (of problems) And stepping up (learning from them), One will graze in GREEN PASTURES.</h2>

        <h1>3. The Elephant Rope</h1>

        <h2>As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being
        held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at
        anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

        He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,”
        trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age,
        it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the
        rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

        The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they
        couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

        Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because
        we failed at it once before?

        Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.</h2>

        <h1>4. Potatoes, Eggs, and Coffee Beans<h1>

        <h2>Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable and that she didn’t know how she
        was going to make it. She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was
        solved, another one soon followed.

        Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Once
        the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot, and ground coffee beans in the
        third pot.

        He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter, moaned and impatiently waited,
        wondering what he was doing.

        After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He
        pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.

        He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup. Turning to her he asked. “Daughter, what do you see?”

        “Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,” she hastily replied.

        “Look closer,” he said, “and touch the potatoes.” She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take
        an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the
        coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face.

        “Father, what does this mean?” she asked.

        He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity– the boiling water.

        However, each one reacted differently.

        The potato went in strong, hard, and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak.

        The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water.
        Then the inside of the egg became hard.

        However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water
        and created something new.

        “Which are you,” he asked his daughter. “When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato,
        an egg, or a coffee bean? </h2>

        <h2>Moral:In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is what happens
        within us.

        Which one are you?</h2>

        <h1>5. A Dish of Ice Cream</h1>

        <h2>In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a
        table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.

        “How much is an ice cream sundae?”

        “50 cents,” replied the waitress.

        The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it.

        “How much is a dish of plain ice cream?” he inquired. Some people were now waiting for a table and the waitress was
        a bit impatient.

        “35 cents,” she said brusquely.

        The little boy again counted the coins. “I’ll have the plain ice cream,” he said.

        The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid
        the cashier and departed.

        When the waitress came back, she began wiping down the table and then swallowed hard at what she saw.

        There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were 15 cents – her tip.</h2>
        <h1>6. Box full of kisses </h1>
        <h2>>A businessman scolded his three year old girl for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Difficult times meant money was tight and he became cross when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.

        Nevertheless, the little business owner’s daughter brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, ‘Daddy, this is for you.’

        The man was embarrassed by his earlier overreaction, but his irritation flared again when he found the box was empty. He yelled at the girl, stating, ‘When you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside!’

        The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried, ‘Oh, Daddy, it’s not empty; I blew kisses into the box. They’re all for you, Daddy.’ The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl and he begged for her forgiveness.

        A short time later, an accident took the life of the girl.
        
        It is told that her father kept that gold box by his bed for many years and whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.
        
        Moral of the story: there is no possession in life greater than unconditional love.</h2>
        <h1>The Gold!</h1>
        <h2>During the gold rush, a man who had been mining in Colorado for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t struck gold yet and the work was becoming tiresome.  He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it had been left off.


        The new miner was advised by his engineer that there was gold only three feet away from where the first miner stopped digging.

        The engineer was right, which means the first miner was a mere three feet away from striking gold before he quit.

        The Moral:

        When things start to get hard, try to persevere through the adversity.

        Many people give up on following their dreams because the work becomes too difficult, tedious, or tiresome–but often, you’re closer to the finish line than you may think, and if you push just a little harder, you will succeed.</h2>
        <h1>8. How to Hunt a Monkey (Inspirational Short Story about Letting Go)</h1>
        <h2>“Do you know how hunters of old used to trap monkeys?” A man asked his child.

        “Rather than chasing them up a tree or shooting arrows from below, they’d put a heavy glass jar with a narrow neck on the floor, which had the monkeys’ favourite food inside.

        They’d then step back and hide, waiting for the unsuspecting animal to approach.

        When it did, the monkey would reach inside, clench a fist around the food, and try to pull it out. However, the narrow neck of the jar would stop the poor monkey from getting its hand out!

        It’d pull and pull, but to no avail. There was simply no way to get its hand out of the jar without releasing the food.

        Rather than letting go, though, the monkey would persevere, refusing to drop its dinner.

        The hunters would then approach and catch it to enjoy a meal of their own.”

        “Don’t be like that monkey,” warned the man, “In life, to fight another day and grow as person, you must know when to quit, when to move on, and when to let go of whatever’s holding you back.”

        Moral of the story:

        Sometimes you have to let go and give up what you have now in order to receive something better in the future. Don’t let stubbornness be your downfall!</h2>
